# Audio-Processing-and-Compression

A MATLAB-based implementation of an audio editor compressor is investigated. By varying the input parameters of the audio features, results were obtained that demonstrated the typical behaviour and benefits of compressor use. The parameters correspond to those found on specific hardware or software compressors. Adjustments to the MATLAB code were made to make the controls more understandable to audio practitioners.
